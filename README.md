## Getting Started

To get started with the React Native Food App, follow the installation steps below.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-native-food.git

2. Change into the project directory:

        cd react-native-food

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

        npm install


## Dependencies

The React Native Food App has the following main dependencies:

- "@react-native-community/masked-view": "^0.1.11"
- "axios": "^1.4.0"
- "expo": "~49.0.5"
- "expo-status-bar": "~1.6.0"
- "react": "18.2.0"
- "react-native": "0.72.3"
- "react-navigation": "^4.4.4"
- "react-navigation-stack": "^2.10.4"

For development purposes, the following dev dependencies are used:

- "@babel/core": "^7.20.0"
- "react-native-dotenv": "^3.4.9"

## Yelp API Key

To use the Yelp API in this application, you need to sign up for a Yelp developer account and obtain an API Key.

1. **Sign up for a Yelp Developer Account:** Go to the [Yelp Developer website](https://www.yelp.com/login?return_url=%2Fdevelopers%2Fv3%2Fmanage_app) and sign up for a developer account. If you already have an account, log in.

2. **Create a new Yelp App:** Once you are logged in to your developer account, create a new Yelp App to generate your API Key. Give your app a name and a brief description of its purpose.

3. **Obtain Your API Key:** After creating the app, you will receive an API Key (also called "Client ID"). Copy this key as you will need it to make API requests.

## .env File Configuration

To keep your API Key secure and separate from your codebase, the React Native Food App uses a .env file to store sensitive information. Follow these steps to add your Yelp API Key to the .env file:

1. In the root of your project, create a new file named `.env`.

2. Add the following line to the .env file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Yelp API Key:

        API_AUTHORISATION=Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

3. Save the .env file.

## Usage

To run the React Native Food App, you can use Expo CLI:

1. Start the development server:

        expo start

2. Use the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device to scan the QR code generated by the development server. Alternatively, you can run the app in an Android or iOS simulator.
